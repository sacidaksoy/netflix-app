## Introduction
Build and Deploy an Netflix Clone page with React JS. 

In this project, I used:

- Creating a User Interface using React Native and pure CSS features.
- Working with The Movie Database(TMDB) API
- fetching data from unlimited sources using FETCH requests
- Worked with react-youtube and movie-trailer packages
